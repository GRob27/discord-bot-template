# DISCORD BOT TYPESCRIPT TEMPLATE

Thank you very much for having interest in my work. This project is a template i made to create discord bots
that a user can interact with via commands. It is built with the [discord-akairo](https://github.com/discord-akairo/discord-akairo) librairy.

## How to use this template in my project

1. Clone the template to your local machine
2. cd ./discord-bot-template
3. npm install
4. Go to src/Config.ts and edit the owners with your name.
5. In src/Config.ts, put your bot token under the same name variable. (See [the official discord documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html)
for the steps on how to do that)
6. npm run build
7. npm start
8. Have fun developping :)
